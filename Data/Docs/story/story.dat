We are in the year 2045.

The planet Earth has just experienced the 3rd World War, which was the most destructive war ever experienced.
It was then that a group of very wealthy people who during the war had been hiding in shelters  returned to claim the sovereignty of the world, and as they had the resources that seemed inevitable.

The reaction was expected but it quickly got world-wide to get rid of the original predictions and quickly turn into a global resistance body.
The "Revolutionaries," as they called themselves, having rallied a lot of people on their side, managed to resist the attacks of the saviors successfully, and where the saviors seemed to lose the war suddenly a news came through their workshops.

One of their scientists had managed to create a virus that was able to turn off critical thinking and ability from the human brain so that it would make him an unwritten one that all he could do is accept orders without being able to resist.

Their plan gets ahead and prepares to launch a missile to space that will explode before it passes through the atmosphere and will scatter the virus across the globe.

The Revolutionists learn about this saviors' plan through an informant and are preparing to attack the tower of the Savior laboratories as it is the only hope of saving mankind by managing to disarm the missile.

But the rocket has already been launched and 15 minutes left to do so. The Revolutionaries are near the entrance of the tower and somewhere there counting backwards starts our game.
